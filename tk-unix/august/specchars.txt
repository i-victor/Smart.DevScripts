Special characters in August

August 0.40 has an option to automatically insert html code for country
specific special characters like the Swedish å, ä, ö. You can switch on this
option in "Edit" --> "August options". Right now, the only characters
supported are the Swedish ones. To be able to support more countries I need
help from users. I need to know the special names Tcl/Tk assigns to the
special character keys, and if you need support for your countrys special
characters you can help me by running the "keyname.tcl" script included in
this distribution. Just run "wish keyname.tcl". Then you can hit the keys of
the special characters you want support for, send me the names, and I will
include support in the next release. I really don't know how important this
is, but many other html editors I've seen have support for this so....;-)
